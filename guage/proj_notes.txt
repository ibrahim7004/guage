Financial sentiment analysis Application: 
Sentiment analysis for large number of analyst reports about different stocks, using a pretrained model to predict their sentiment, 
to create an app which allows for users to just feed the report and gain an accurate sentiment analysis. 
Hence user would get an idea about whether the stock is worth buying, should be sold, etc. 

Task Breakdown:

1. *Extract Text from Analyst Report PDF'S:* 
- Python script to iterate through all reports in folder, and extract text from each one by one.
- extracting specific sections chosen by annotator as most important: highlights (pg 1), investment rationale (pg 1), industry outlook (pg 4).

2. *Keyword Extraction:* 
- Preprocessing text using NLP techniques. 
2.1 *Optional for now:*
- Decide on assignment of weights.
- Normalize vectorized DF.
- Other preprocessing steps/ refine some steps.

3. *Module 3:*
- Writing script to extract text from all pdfs
- Writing script to combine selective columns from both CSV's.

4. *Apply Model:* 
- Split data into train/test datasets. 
- Pass final data (keywords) to a pretrained LLM (Using inference api - huggingface). 
- Compile the results (sentiment scores) as excel/csv.
- Evaluate accuracy by testing model on test data.
- Deal with large text issue by using chunk-size approach.

5. Deployment on Flask:
- User can give input text of any length, or drop a pdf directly and get output sentiment.
