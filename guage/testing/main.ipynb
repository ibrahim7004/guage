The fall in \\nearnings was mainly caused by Ocean (-76% Y/\\nY; -33% Q/Q) on reduced freight rates (-51% Y/\\nY; -15% Q/Q) and weaker volumes (-6% Y/Y; \\n+7% Q/Q). \\nuMaersk lifted the bottom end of its 2023 EBITDA \\nguidance to USD9.5-USD11.0 billion from \\nUSD8.0-11.0 billion reflecting the stronger H1 \\n2023 results but lowered its 2023 market \\nvolume outlook to -4.0% to -1.0% (previously -\\n2.5% to +0.5%) on continued inventory \\ncorrection till the end of 2023. We think the \\nimplied sequential drop in H1 2023 earnings \\nreflects the ongoing decline in Maersk’s \\ncontracted rate given that they are being reset \\nto a level nearer to the spot which has fallen \\nsharply since mid-2022. Also, we gathered that \\nthe industry’s supply of new vessels may \\nincrease freight capacity by 9% and 10% in \\n2023 and 2024 respectively, which we think will \\noutgrow demand causing overcapacity and \\nfurther deterioration in freight rates.\\nuWe forecast EPS of USD220 for 2023 and \\nUSD100 for 2024 as we expect a further \\nweakness in freight rates.', 'Highlights\\nuWe expect 2023 total sales to contract 9%  to \\n$39.6 billion, following growth of 1% in 2022. \\nSales in 2021 saw a huge boost from the surge \\nin demand for Covid-19 tests, which brought in \\nrevenue of approximately $7.7 billion for ABT, or \\n18% of total sales. We expect Covid-19 sales \\nwill drop to $1.4 billion in 2023 (vs. $8.4 billion \\nin 2022), as demand wanes following the end of \\nthe public health emergency.   We see total sales \\nreturning to 5% growth in 2024 with \\nacceleration in key franchises such as Alinity \\n(Diagnostic systems), Freestyle Libre \\n(Diabetes), and MitraClip (Heart).\\nuThe pandemic upset ABT’s high growth \\nsegments: medical devices and non-Covid-19 \\ndiagnostics.

The 2020 acquisition of the \\nformer Allergan also brought in significant \\ngrowth contributors in medical aesthetics and \\nneuroscience areas. These latter areas \\ncontributed almost $12 billion in revenues in \\n2022. \\nuABBV’s revenues have historically been largely \\ntied to sales of its blockbuster drug, Humira, \\nwhich began to experience biosimilar \\ncompetition outside of the U.S. (OUS) in October \\n2018. In 2022, U.S. Humira sales grew 7.4% \\nversus 2021, while OUS sales of Humira \\ndeclined 22%.

Also, \\nOMV’s Q2 2023 operational performance was \\nuninspiring, in our view, as the utilization rates \\nof refineries and steam crackers were merely \\n73% and 83%, respectively (lower than initial \\n2023 guidance of 95% and 90%, respectively), \\nwhereas hydrocarbon production was down 7% \\nY/Y to 353 kboe/d. Operating cash flow pre-\\nworking capital turned negative in Q2 2023, \\nlifting leverage to 11% versus 2% in Q1 2023. \\nuOMV lowered its 2023 guidance by slashing \\nestimated oil & gas price realization, polyolefin \\nmargin, and refining margin alongside reducing \\nthe estimated utilization rate of crackers and \\nrefinery.
