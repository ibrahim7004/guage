Sales are being \\nled by demand across Creative Cloud (+9% in \\nMay-Q; 59% of sales), Document Cloud (+11%; \\n14%) and Experience Cloud (+12%; 22%), with \\nstrength in Digital Media ($470M net new ARR). \\nWe see higher monetization of non-paying \\nusers because of the tethered cloud model and \\ndown-market adoption of Creative Cloud with \\nmore affordable bundles as well as cross-sell \\nopportunities. We anticipate higher sales in \\nDocument Cloud, benefiting from the ongoing \\ngrowth  of  e-signatures, often as part of digital \\ntransformation projects.

We positively view \\nADBE’s generative AI roadmap, with Firefly \\nattracting significant interest across platforms \\n(e.g., Photoshop, Illustrator), with 0.5B assets \\ncreated in beta (more than 80x anticipated). We \\nthink early indications show AI offers significant \\nvalue to customers and will have potential \\nupside to monetization efforts, as Firefly is \\noffered as both as a standalone freemium \\noffering for consumers and a separate \\nenterprise offering. We see increasing \\ncontribution from Document Cloud and like \\noperational execution.\\nuRisks to our recommendation and target price \\ninclude a hack or data theft or, over time, share \\nloss and pricing pressure from cheaper or free \\nalternatives to Creative Cloud, especially apps \\noptimized for touch screens and mobile devices.\\nuOur 12-month target price of $580 is based on \\na P/E of 32x our CY 2024 EPS estimate of \\n$18.12, above peers but below historical \\naverages.

Copyright © 2023  CFRA. 2\\nBusiness Summary Jun 16, 2023\\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW. Adobe (ADBE) is the largest provider of applications used to produce visual content, \\nbest known for its Creative Cloud apps, Photoshop (#1 in photo editing, raster graphics), Illustrator (#1 in \\ndrawing, vector graphics), InDesign (#1 in page layout), and Premiere Pro (#1 in video editing). Its apps are \\nused by graphic designers, photographers, publishers, video producers, animators, and other creative \\nprofessionals ADBE estimates at 49 million globally, growing 11% per year since ‘15. ADBE’s apps are also \\nused by students, hobbyists, and part-time artists. Pro or not, today’s creatives are rapidly replacing or \\nfortifying physical media artistic expression with digital media. From simple photo filters to full-blown 3D \\nanimation, this surge in digital media is a trend with lots of room to run, in our view.\\nThe company operates through three segments: Digital Media (73% of May-Q revenue), Digital Experience \\n(25%), and Publishing and Advertising (2%).\\nThe flagship of ADBE’s Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud, a subscription service that allows \\nmembers to use its creative products integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktop, web, and \\nmobile devices. Users can choose between the speed and ease of use of Adobe Express, the company’s \\ntask-based, template-first web and mobile application, or the greater power and precision of its flagship \\nCreative Cloud applications. The company’s customers rely on its products for content creation, photo \\nediting, design, video and animation production, mobile app and gaming development, and more. The \\ncompany has significant opportunities to grow by advancing every creative category across devices and the \\nweb, expanding content-first, task-based creativity with Adobe Express and 3D and immersive content \\ncreation with Substance 3D. ADBE’s Digital Media segment also includes its Adobe Document Cloud \\nbusiness, a unified, cloud-based document services platform, which integrates Adobe’s pioneering PDF \\ntechnology with its Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Sign applications to deliver fully digital document workflows. \\nWithin Digital Experience, Adobe Experience Cloud is powering digital businesses by providing  experiences to \\ntheir customers via a comprehensive suite of solutions. The company helps businesses and enterprises \\ninvest in solutions that aid their goals to transform how they engage with their customers and constituents \\ndigitally.\\nThe Publishing and Advertising segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market \\nopportunities, including eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web conferencing, document \\nand forms platform, web application development, high-end printing, and the company’s Adobe Advertising \\nCloud offerings.\\nCOMPANY HISTORY. In ‘82, John Warnock and Charles Geschke left Xerox PARC to start Adobe out of the \\nWarnock’s garage in Los Altos, California. Its first product was PostScript, a Page Description Language \\n(PDL) allowing any application to print to any printer and have the output match the screen image, a feature \\nknown as “WYSIWYG,” for “what you see is what you get.” While this seems trivial today, PostScript solved a \\nkey compatibility issue for PC and Mac users simply trying to print documents. PostScript opened the door \\nfor third-party printers to enter the market and laid the foundation for the rise of desktop publishing, a \\nfrequent justification for purchasing Macs and, a little later, Wintel PCs. Success was catalyzed by a ‘85 deal \\nto license PostScript to Apple for five years. Apple built PostScript into all Macs and a new line of printers, \\ncementing an early lead in desktop publishing for both companies.\\nADBE capitalized on this lead in the late ‘80s  by adding the core apps of its Creative Suite bundle, now \\nCreative Cloud: Photoshop, Illustrator, and PageMaker by Aldus, which ADBE acquired in ‘94, then replaced \\nwith InDesign. In ‘93, ADBE extended PostScript to include all printable aspects of a document (i.e., text, \\nfonts, vector graphics, and raster images) in a single file for a consistent printed output independent of app, \\noperating system, or printer, establishing the widely used Portable Document Format or “PDF” format. \\nAcrobat, the app creating and viewing PDFs, was never a big revenue contributor, but, as the PDF standard \\nhas incorporated more interactive elements, ADBE launched a bundle of Acrobat and related apps as \\nDocument Cloud in ‘15, with digital signatures, encryption, access control, annotations, etc., targeting the \\nautomation of document-based processes, and has benefited considerably from the need to complete \\ntransactions remotely with e-signatures. \\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. As ADBE began shifting to a subscription-based model, it hit an initial “subscription \\nshift headwind” limited growth from ‘11 through ‘15. The headwind occurred because a traditional Creative \\nSuite license sale was more than twice the revenue from the first year of a Creative Cloud subscription. \\nWhen subscriptions exceed 50% of total revenue, the headwind becomes a tailwind because, over the six \\nyears between major version upgrades, a Creative Cloud subscription brings in about 3x more than a new \\nCreative Suite license sale (including annual support at 20% of the license sale with about one third of  \\ncustomer uptake) and roughly 5x vs. upgrades and support revenue from existing customers. When \\nsubscription revenue jumped from 50% of the total in FY 14 to 67% in FY 15, total revenue growth \\naccelerated from 2% in FY 14 to 16% in FY 15, then grew 20%+ Y/Y until FY 20 when Covid-19 dropped it to \\n16%. In FY 21, revenue growth came right back to 23%, then fell to 12% in FY 22 as the subscription shift \\ntailwind faded, economic growth slowed, and  the dollar strengthened.\\nThis headwind-tailwind dynamic plays out for profitability, too, though with some lag. The initial headwind \\ndrove operating margin into the teens before recovering to 26% in FY 16. Since then, operating margin has \\nrisen consistently, even during the pandemic, hitting 40% in FY 19, 43% in FY 20, and 46% in FY 21, before \\nslipping to 45% in FY 22. As its tethered cloud model continues to scale, we expect operating margin to \\npush past 50% in FY 26, a level traditional software businesses rarely attain.Corporate information\\nInvestor contact\\nJ.

Management observed similar \\ntraits of greater cloud optimization behavior with \\nclients; clients are more carefully inspecting their \\ndata usage and storage volumes with cloud \\nservices, and becoming more judicious about \\nexceeding data limits in order to avoid incurring \\noverage charges. Layoffs, especially in the \\ntechnology sector, have also lowered software \\nneeds (especially with seat-based software \\nsubscriptions), and increased spending scrutiny \\nwith added layers of approval have slowed the \\npace of deal close rates, increased deferrals and \\ncancellations, longer sales cycles, and deals \\nslipping out of the quarter. Cumulatively, the \\nimpact from these factors have led to sluggish \\nannual recurring revenue (ARR) and remaining \\nperformance obligations (RPO) growth, as well as \\nsmaller deal sizes. We expect these sales patterns \\nto continue in Q2, pressuring top-line growth. \\nHowever, we also see weakness potentially \\nbottoming out in Q2 and growth to pick up in 2H \\n2023 as we lap these challenging quarters. With \\neasier comparisons ahead and likely more positive \\nsentiment on the economy, we believe companies \\nwill begin to incrementally increase their \\ninvestments on important growth and \\ntransformation projects and deferred upgrades. In \\nfact, technology research firm Gartner raised its \\nworldwide IT spending in 2023 to 12.3% Y/Y, up \\nfrom its previous forecast of 9.3% in the early part \\nof the year. Likewise, software constituents in the \\nS&P 500 are projected to report revenue growth of \\n9.8% Y/Y for 2023, up 80 bps from its earlier \\nconsensus forecast of 9% a quarter ago. We see \\nthis as a solid indicator of a recovery in the \\nindustry.\\nIt would be remiss of us to not mention AI and its impact on software’s outlook. We think AI (and \\nGenerative AI) will be the catalyst for new \\nproduct interest and capability growth within \\nsoftware as vendors prioritize infusing AI \\nalgorithms and leveraging large language \\nmodels to generate new services and features, \\nwhile enhancing performance and \\neffectiveness of their current offerings. \\nLeading vendors have already begun to set the \\npace with a slew of AI-powered product \\nlaunches, notably Microsoft, and we expect a \\ntrend to start with other software firms over \\nthe next year. During the Q1 earnings \\nconference calls, many firms reported \\nexperimenting with generative AI technologies \\nto build new features in their solutions. A \\nhandful expect new product releases at the \\nend of the year. We see significant \\nopportunities for generative AI technologies to \\nbe incorporated into application software to \\nenhance productivity, automate work \\nprocesses, extract valuable insights in \\nanalytics, and improve observability and \\napplication performance monitoring \\ncapabilities.\\nWith top-line growth still facing headwinds in \\nQ2, we would expect tighter expense \\nmanagement to persist with most firms, \\ndriving margin expansion on a year-over-year \\nbasis. We raise our 2023 EPS growth forecast \\nfor software firms in the S&P 500 by 290 bps \\nto 13.7%, reflecting margin gains and a \\nstronger revenue growth outlook in the second \\nhalf of the year. \\n / Janice QuekStock Report | September 09, 2023  |  NasdaqGS  Symbol: ADBE  | ADBE is in the S&P 500     \\nAdobe Inc.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.
